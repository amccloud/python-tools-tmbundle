Python Tools TextMate Bundle
============================

PyFlakes
========

* *Validate Syntax* (⌃⇧V) validates the syntax of the file using PyFlakes and shows the results in a new window.
* *Validate Syntax Quick* (⌘S) same as above except that instead of a dedicated window you simply get a tooltip showing the the errors and warnings.
